# Phase 1: 3GPP FTP Crawler Walkthrough

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the core crawler for the 3GPP FTP server. This crawler is designed to mirror specific meeting documents (TDocs, Reports) and Specifications to a local directory, which serves as the foundation for the "Prior Art Search Engine".

## Changes Implemented
-   **Crawler Module ([crawler/crawler.py](file:///C:/Users/aaron/.gemini/antigravity/brain/2a86ebd5-78a4-493c-80df-6842366fd007/crawler/crawler.py))**: Handles FTP connection, navigation, and "Delta Sync" (skipping existing files).
-   **Configuration ([crawler/config.py](file:///C:/Users/aaron/.gemini/antigravity/brain/2a86ebd5-78a4-493c-80df-6842366fd007/crawler/config.py))**: Centralized config for FTP credentials and target paths.
-   **Verification Script ([verify_crawler.py](file:///C:/Users/aaron/.gemini/antigravity/brain/2a86ebd5-78a4-493c-80df-6842366fd007/verify_crawler.py))**: Validates connectivity and directory listing.

## Verification Results
We ran a verification script to confirm the crawler can connect to `ftp.3gpp.org` and navigate to a specific meeting folder (`TSGR1_104-e`).

## Next Steps
The crawler is ready to be integrated into the broader pipeline.
-   **Phase 2**: We will build the "Refinery" to parse these downloaded files (Word/Zip) and extract clean text.
