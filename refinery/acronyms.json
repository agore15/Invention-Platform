    "NOTE:": "For full definition, see 23.101 [8], clause 6.2.; In UTRAN, a Cell is either FDD or TDD mode. For E-UTRAN and NG-RAN, a cell is a combination of downlink and optionally uplink resources. The linking between the carrier frequency of the downlink resources and the carrier frequency of the uplink resources is indicated in the system information transmitted on the downlink resources.; the term \"user information unit\" has been replaced by the term \"service data unit\".; this includes the case of UMTS <>GSM handover where - are the same in both cases.; A MTC Device might also communicate locally (wirelessly, possibly through a PAN, or hardwired) with other entities which provide the MTC Device \"raw data\" for processing and communication to the MTC Server(s) and/or other MTC Device(s). Local communication between MTC Device(s) and other entities is out of scope of this technical specification.; Typically a M2M service provider is the party holding subscriptions in order to provide connectivity between MTC Devices and the MTC Server. In practise certain roles can collapse, e.g. the network operator acts as the same time as Service Provider.; the source document term \"user information unit\" has been replaced by the term \"service data unit\".; the value(s) assigned to one or more service attributes may be used to distinguish that telecommunications service from others.; In particular Service Continuity encompasses the possibility that after a RAT / domain change the user experience is maintained by a different telecommunication service (e.g. tele- or bearer service) than before the RAT / domain change.",
